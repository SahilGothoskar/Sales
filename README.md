PROJECT NAME/TOPIC :SALES

Abstract:

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is one of the most well-known and valuable brands in the world. Walmart is one of the leading stores in the United States with about 4,742 stores all over US.There is sales data available for the 45 stores and we would like to predict sales of various stores and how they differ from each other. The dataset should be used to determine which location has the most sales and the largest market capitalization. What do they do differently that helps them increase their sales? Throughout the year, Walmart holds several promotional markdown events.These sales occur before major holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Weeks with these holidays are weighted five times more heavily in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data is part of the challenge presented by this competition.
There is historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores in various regions.

Goals:

Which retailer has the highest sales
Which retailer's standard deviation is the highest
Consequently, there are wide variations in sales.
Likewise, determine the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation.
Which retailer(s) has/have the best quarterly growth rate in Q3?
Sales may suffer over certain holidays.
Find out which holidays have more sales than the average non-holiday season sales for all of the stores combined.
Give insights and a monthly and semester snapshot of the sales in units.
A thorough summary of the sales analysis so that other market competitors or new startups can identify the elements that boost sales and the difficulties that depress sales.

Factors:


Store - the store number
Date - the week of sales
Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store
Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week
